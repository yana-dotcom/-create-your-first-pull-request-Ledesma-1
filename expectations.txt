My expectations for our course CMSC 100 are to learn more about web development, specifically to gain more experience in making meaningful web applications. I am excited not only to improve my knowledge on using HTML and JavaScript but also to be able to learn new technologies (React, Express, etc). I am a bit interested currently on the frontend aspect of web programming but I would also like to explore on the backend aspect and gain more experience on it, since for now, I find it to be quite challenging and a bit complicated >< Lastly, while I expect this course to be challenging, I am also hoping to have fun while learning! :))
